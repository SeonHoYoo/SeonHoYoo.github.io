  Hi, my name is SeonHo Yoo, and I aspire to become an **AI researcher** who is **boundless**, **growth-driven**, and **irreplaceable**. I constantly challenge my own limits, seek opportunities to evolve through every experience, and strive to build a unique value that cannot be replicated.

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark> and <mark>Eating Pizza</mark>

  I am most interested in <mark>Graph-driven Representation & Decision Making</mark> and <mark>Mathematical Optimization for Machine Learning</mark>.
  - Self-Supervised & Pre-training on Graphs
  - Graph-based Anomaly Detection
  - Combinatorial Optimization on Graphs
  - Graph-augmented Reinforcement Learning

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
